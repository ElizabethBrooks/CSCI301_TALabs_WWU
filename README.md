# CS301_WWU
Syllabus for CS 301 labs at WWU, Fall 2016.

## Lab Objectives and Plan
The final objective [of the course] is to acquire introductory level competence in functional programming, specically
with the Scheme language. For this purpose, we will use the Racket programming environment, which is available on all the laboratory machines. A free download for your home machines is also available over the internet. All instruction in the Scheme language will occur in the weekly laboratory sessions.

In parallel with our progress through the texts, we will be studying the Scheme programming language as an example of how mathematical reasoning might be automated. The general idea in any programming language is to start with a few simple operations that can be combined in imaginative ways to develop more complicated tasks.

In Scheme, the basic operation is recursion. Indeed, in the version that you will be learning in the lab, you will attempt to solve all of your assignments using primarily recursion,  together with a very small collection of initial primitives. Some of the assignments will involve implementing operations on sets and functions as described in The Book of Proof. Others will involve problems that you would likely prefer to solve in a procedural language, such as Java.  But, with a little thought, you will learn to use recursion in a more abstract fashion.

Please see the syllabus for further details about the course.

## Lab Description
The primary programming activity in Scheme is the creation of recursive definitions, where problems are solved in terms of itself. By progressively working through the increasingly difficult problems in each chapter of the text The Little Schemer, it will be possible to complete the weekly assigned labs. Be sure to attempt the example schemes readily available throughout the text, frame notes preceded by “S:” concern Scheme.

## Scheme Description
Scheme expressions, or S-Expressions for Symbolic Expressions, are composed of lists or atoms. These expressions are used to construct recursive processes and manipulate recursive data-structures. Processes in Scheme use lists to represent function calls or collections of data. Primitive data types, or atoms include the following: boolean constants (t and f), numbers (integers, reals, and rationals), strings (e.g. “hello world!”), characters (e.g. #\c), and symbols (e.g. x, b11, sam).

## Scheme Tips
* The Scheme Programming section of WikiBooks has some very helpful and well written information and tips for creating symbolic expressions (s-expressions) in Scheme: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming 
* There are several different ways to create lists, for example: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming/List_Operations
* You may also define variables for later use in Scheme expressions: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scheme_Programming/Using_Variables 
* The following site offers a Scheme tutorial by UCSC that provides good descriptions and examples of common functions: https://classes.soe.ucsc.edu/cmps112/Spring03/languages/scheme/SchemeTutorialA.html#functions
